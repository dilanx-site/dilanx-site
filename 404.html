                    I'm completely redesigning my website from scratch. When
                    completed, the new site will feature a completely new
                    navigation system, a redesigned layout, and a ton of other
                    cool things. It'll all be mobile-friendly, too (unlike the
                    old site). Until it's done, you might encounter a lot of
                    broken links as you click through things. They'll all be
                    resolved soon as I continue developing. Thanks for waiting!

                    If you came to learn more about dilanxd.com authentication
                    or read the privacy policy, I apologize lol. I have not made
                    either of those pages yet (but I will eventually). I promise
                    I do nothing bad with your data (I only store your email)
                    and you're always welcome to contact me to learn more about
                    my privacy practices.
